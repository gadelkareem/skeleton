      designed for children under 16, and children under the age of 16 are not authorized to access or
      use our services. If we discover that a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personal
      information, we will endeavor to purge any such information as soon as possible.

      manner. We will post any updates to this Policy on our SITE. You should periodically check for
      any modifications of this Policy by re-visiting this web page. If we make any changes to this
      Policy that materially affect our practices with regard to the personal information we have

      change by highlighting the change on our SITE
    </p>
    <h2>
      III. Information that we collect
    </h2>
    <p>
      Visitors to our SITE and services will have multiple manners of interacting with us. Depending
      upon your level of interaction, we will collect different information about you. We collect
      information about you directly from you and from third parties, as well as automatically through
      your use of our SITE. The type of information collected is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Members</b> - Members are those users who subscribe to our services will be prompted to
        provide their name, their address, their age, their phone number, and any other necessary
        billing information.
      </li>
      <li><b>Posters</b> - Posters are visitors to our SITE who choose to register to post information
        in our public forums. We collect your email address and the password you create for your
        account when you register, and we also collect information about your posts to our forums.
        Any information entered voluntarily by the Poster on one of our forums should be considered
        public information or information that is publicly available. If you do not wish for
        information to be made public, you should not enter it into your user profile when
        registering as a Poster.
      </li>
      <li><b>All SITE users and visitors</b> - We automatically collect the following information from
        all users and visitors to our SITE through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies:
        your domain name; your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you
        click; your IP address; the length of time you visit or use our SITE; and the referring URL,
        or the webpage that led you to our SITE. We may combine this information with other
        information that we have collected about you, including, where applicable, your user name,
        name, and other personal information. Please see the section “Cookies and Other Tracking
        Mechanisms” below for more information.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      IV. Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
    </h2>
    <p>
      We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms, including
      those designed for mobile applications, to track information about your use of our SITE. We may
      combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third
      party service providers may do so on our behalf).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Cookies.</b> Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device’s hard
        drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it
        easier for you to navigate our SITE, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process
        or to allow us to track your activities at our SITE and service, including for online
        advertising purposes.
      </li>
      <li><b>Disabling Cookies.</b> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer,
        you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the
        toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new
        cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
        cookies altogether. Visitors to our SITE who disable cookies will be able to browse certain
        areas of the SITE, but some features may not function.
      </li>
      <li><b>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</b> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a
        unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored
        on your device’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use
        clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our SITE to,
        among other things, track the activities of SITE visitors and users, help us manage content,
        and compile statistics about SITE usage. We and our third party service providers also use
        clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify
        when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
      </li>
      <li><b>Third Party Analytics.</b> We use automated devices and applications, such as Google
        Analytics, to evaluate usage of our SITE. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate
        our SITE. We use these tools to help us improve our services, performance, and user
        experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their
        services. To learn more about Google’s privacy practices, please review the Google Policy at
        <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/&quot;">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.
        You can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent their data from
        being used by Google Analytics at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.
      </li>
      <li><b>Do-Not-Track.</b> Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track”
        requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by
        disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the
        instructions in the Third Party Ad Network section.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Third-Party Ad Networks.</b> We use third parties such as network advertisers to
          serve advertisements on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking
          platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for
          products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network
          providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies,
          JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking
          technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising
          content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each
          third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party
          advertisers with information, including personal information, about you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you
          may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Consumer Choice Page</a> for
          information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding
          having information used by <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/participating/">DAA
            companies</a>. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> for
          information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding
          having information used by <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/participating-networks">NAI members</a>.
        </p>
        Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Consumer Choice Page</a> or the NAI <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> will opt
        you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does
        not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our SITE or on other websites.
        You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website
        that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured
        to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be
        effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a> or the NAI’s website at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.

      information. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent
      third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining this information. We take reasonable measures to
      prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals we are
      unable to guarantee that our security is 100% breach-proof. You assume the risk of such breaches
      to the extent that they occur despite our reasonable security measures.
